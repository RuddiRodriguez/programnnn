linfitparameter = 3 % number of points to each side of a given point for the linear fit 

meanparameter = 6 % number of points to each side of a given point for which the mean grey value will be calculated

pixeltestparameter = 1.221730477; % parameter for the angle in the second pixelpositiontest; see the pixelpositiontest function

directioncondition = 0.5; % parameter that represents the minimal change of the mean of the 10 last membranepositions in x- and y-direction for which tracking will continue in the given direction; default=0.05

lastpositions = 10; % number of last pixels/membrainpositions over which the algorithm will calculate the mean change in x- and y-direction

directiondetectionstart = 10; % gives the number of starting points for which xdirection=1 and ydirection=1 are set; default=10

directionchange = 80; % parameter that determines after what amount of iterations a new direction change can occur

slopediff = 30; % this parameter determines for the function 'newpixposmethod2' the minimum value that a slope has to be bigger than the other three

methode4parameter = 0.25; % parameter that determines what length the x-/y-abcisses in the function newpixposmethod4 must have in order for the newpixpos to be chosen in that direction; see file newpixposmethod4.m for details

comparepixel = 20; % this is the index i of the pixel at which the algorithm will start to check against to see whether the contour is closed; it will do this against the number of following points given by the parameter "closingpoints"; this means that the algorithm will check from i=comparepixel to i=comparepixel to i=comparepixel+numberofcomparepixel to see if the contour is closed. i.e.: the pixel position comparepixel also determines how many pixels of "run-in-time" the algorithm will receive to find the membrane position correctly

nrofcomparepixel = 50; % this parameter gives the number of pixels with with which the algorithm will compare the current pixel i to see if the contour is closed

maxwanderof = 30; % this parameter serves a break off condition of the detection algorithm if it wanders away from the membrane more than "maxwanderof"

maxnrofpoints = 800; % this parameter determines the maximum number of membrane points to be detected; literature: 700-2000

surroundings = 70; % this parameter set the number of pixels to be selected around the vesicle

newcentersteps = 0; % this paramater determines after how many steps the center of the contours will be newly calculated; it is only relevant if the vesicle is moving on the images            

displaystart = 1000; % parameter to control when the first image of the already tracked points will be shown; only for control purposes

displayincrement = 1; % paramter to control after how many iterations the next image will be shown

maxlengthdeviation = 1; % parameter giving the maximum length in percent by which a contour is allowed to deviate from the mean value of the measurement ensemble, before being eliminated

mincontourlength = 640; % parameter determining the minimum length the mempos vector must have in order not to be rejected

maxangle = 0.8; % maximum angle permitted between the vector of the last and the first 10 points (in radiants)

nmax = 100; % maximal index of the coefficients of the fouriertransformation to be calculated

maxc = 1; % maximum value permited for the coefficients c(n); if a contour give larger value, it will be deleted

resolution = 14e-8; %0.0000001; % this parameter gives the resolution of the microscope (meters per pixel)

firstdatapoint = 5; % number of the wavenumber the lower bound of the region the fitting function fits on

lastdatapoint =  23; % number of the wavenumber the upper bound of the region the fitting function fits on

firstdisplayedcontours = 100; % gives the number of the first contours that will be displayed during tracking

maxcenterchange = 5; % this check serves to prevent the center from making to big a jump from one contour to the next, such as may happen when the algorithm didn't track the contour correctly, but still recognized the contour as being closed
